• Utilizing data from a 2018 survey at a Japanese international university, I’ve found that international students face heightened mental health challenges, notably in social connections and cultural adaptation. Using PostgreSQL, I’m analyzing student data to validate these findings and explore the role of the length of stay.

Based on the analysis of the provided dataset, it appears that there is a correlation between the length of stay for international university students and their mental health indicators. 
Specifically, as the length of stay increases, there is a trend towards higher average scores for depression (average_phq) and acculturative stress (avg_as), while social connectedness (average_scs) tends to decrease slightly. 
This suggests that longer stays in a foreign country may indeed have an impact on the mental health of international students. However, it’s essential to consider various factors and conduct further research to fully understand the relationship between studying abroad and mental health outcomes.
